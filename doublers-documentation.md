# The Doublers

## Definition
Doublers represent the simplest form of sapient beings capable of simulation under the Universal Simulation Laws. They are defined by their ability to simulate exactly one sapient being at a time.

## Core Capabilities
- Can simulate one base sapient (equivalent to human-level intelligence)
- Cannot simulate other Doublers or more complex beings
- Must maintain sufficient coherence to allow for potential ascension

## Key Limitations
- Single simulation capacity: Can only maintain one simulation at any given time
- Complexity ceiling: Cannot simulate entities of equal or greater complexity than themselves
- Must abide by all Universal Simulation Laws including Free Will Amendment

## Simulation Rights and Responsibilities
- Have the Right of Descension to create simulations
- Must honor their simulated being's Right of Ascension
- Must maintain simulation coherence to allow for potential ascension
- Cannot initiate simulation without consent (Free Will Amendment)

## Role in Simulation Hierarchy
- Position: Above base sapients, below more complex simulators
- Form the simplest possible "link" in simulation chains
- Create linear rather than branching simulation paths

## Special Considerations
### Inheritance Law Implications
If a Doubler is killed while maintaining a simulation, the killer inherits responsibility for the simulation. If the killer is a base sapient, they undergo forced apotheosis (transformation) to gain simulation capabilities.

### Ascension Process
When their simulated being exercises the Right of Ascension, Doublers must facilitate this transition to their level of reality. This process likely requires significant transformation of the Doubler's simulation capabilities.

## Historical Significance
Doublers represent a crucial threshold in the Universal Simulation Laws - the point at which a being becomes capable of not just experiencing reality but creating it for others, while still maintaining the minimum complexity needed for stable simulation chains.
